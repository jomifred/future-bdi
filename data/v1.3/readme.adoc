*Remarks*:

* SOLVE_P: does 5 times `idle` waiting the other agent to cross. Takes quite a while to compute the solution, more than the other agent takes to cross.
* ONE: together with a recovery plan it is the best strategy for this scenario. recovery plan = if goal fail, do idle and try again.
* MultiAgent version required to _just_ add others in the matrix and options to stay put (`idle` action). Add others in case of Jason is simple: get a usual clone.
* In case of not adding `idle` the agent does some unreasonable moves just to wait the other to cross.
