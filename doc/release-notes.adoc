= Release notes

== version 1.1

- more scenarios: U, H, O and improved GUI
- initial experiments
- consider cost
- uses priority queue (cost+preference)
- new strategy: solve_m
- notion of zone1: all "first level" options = first options (from default options) + options until failure using policy
- cost weight: a number that distinguishes the 3 strategies (no more specific algorithms, just this parameter)

== version 1.0

- scenario line ok

- store solution found when looking ahead and use it (do not reconsider options every step)

- type of problem: handles goal not achieved
- considers preference

- strategies: one, solve_(p|f), using a (no priority) queue

- generic for any Jason program (given and environment model)
